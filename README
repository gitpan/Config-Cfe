This perl-module contains functions that ease updating
small text files, usually configuration files.
It is easy to write small scripts that can do editing
in 'batch mode', a necessary thing when updating *many*
hosts at the same time.

There is a simple program, update-cfe, that can be
used in shell scripts for those who like that.
(Sometimes update-cfe is enough to update a section
in a file.)


As the name suggests, cfe is modelled after the builtin editor
in cfengine (a very nice program, but I like perl... :-).
And it can only edit files, it can not do all the other stuff that
cfengine does.
